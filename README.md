# slotlock

**A reservation API that cannot double-book — five ways to make sure, tested and measured.**

[![CI](https://github.com/ilia-muravev-dev/slotlock/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ilia-muravev-dev/slotlock/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Meeting rooms are exclusive; hot-desk pools have a capacity. A booking is *held* while the
customer pays, *confirmed* by the payment webhook, or *expired* by a worker. Every way a second
booking could sneak into the same seat is closed and proven: concurrent requests, retried
requests, webhooks arriving out of order or twice, lost expiry jobs, duplicate queue deliveries.

The reserve step exists in five implementations behind one interface, selected by
`BOOKING_STRATEGY`, plus a sixth — `naive`, the bug — kept as a control. The same k6 race runs
against each and a verifier judges the database afterwards.

## The numbers

2026-09-18T18:57:11.898Z, commit `2b1bbff`, Apple M1 Pro (8 cores, 16 GB), darwin arm64, Node v24.21.0, PostgreSQL 17.11 in Docker, pool size 20. 100 VUs for 20s per strategy, release ratio 0.8.

| Strategy | req/s | p50 ms | p95 ms | p99 ms | 201 / 409 / other | retries | overlaps / over capacity | invariants |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | :---: |
| `advisory` | 1416 | 66.6 | 92.6 | 138.0 | 1106 / 26359 / 0 | – | 0 / 0 | ✅ |
| `for_update` | 1407 | 66.9 | 91.9 | 138.8 | 1062 / 26261 / 0 | – | 0 / 0 | ✅ |
| `optimistic` | 1405 | 64.9 | 89.8 | 206.3 | 909 / 26499 / 34 | 1078 | 0 / 0 | ✅ |
| `serializable` | 1508 | 60.0 | 80.7 | 174.4 | 981 / 28437 / 9 | 944 | 0 / 0 | ✅ |
| `exclusion` | 1867 | 49.4 | 70.9 | 126.2 | 1019 / 35545 / 0 | 0 | 0 / 0 | ✅ |
| `naive` | 1643 | 57.1 | 75.5 | 114.2 | 1070 / 30992 / 0 | – | 18 / 5 | ❌ |

Written by `just bench-all` into [`docs/benchmarks/`](docs/benchmarks/README.md), never edited by
hand; the per-strategy reports carry the full latency distribution and the run parameters.

What they say:

- **All five keep both invariants; the control breaks them within seconds.** The verifier
  (`bench/verify.ts`) counts a booking as holding its seat from creation until it was cancelled
  or expired, so a double booking that was cancelled a moment later still counts. `naive`
  double-booked rooms 18 times and overfilled the pool
  5 times in 20 s.
- **Waiting is cheaper than retrying under this contention.** `advisory` and `for_update` queue
  callers per resource and never fail; `optimistic` and `serializable` detect the conflict after
  the fact and try again — `optimistic` retried 1078 times and gave up
  34 times (503 `retry_exhausted`), `serializable` retried
  944 times and gave up 9 times. The optimistic
  version lives on the *resource* row, so two bookings of different slots of the same room
  conflict with each other; a per-slot version would fix that and is left as the obvious next
  step.
- **The exclusion constraint is the fastest and the least code, with two catches.** Its 409 path
  is a single `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; the others count first. But it cannot express
  "at most N" (pools fall back to advisory), and a *plain* insert against it deadlocks under
  contention — [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-five-ways-to-serialise-a-booking.md) records how the
  first version of this repository found that out.
- Latency here is dominated by 100 virtual users sharing a pool of 20 connections on one laptop;
  read the columns against each other, not as absolute numbers.

## What is proven, and where

| Invariant | Mechanism | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A room never has two active bookings that overlap; a pool never exceeds its capacity | one of five reserve strategies, in the database | [`bookings.race.test.ts`](test/integration/bookings.race.test.ts): 50 concurrent requests for one slot → 1 × 201, 49 × 409, one row — for every strategy; 20 on a pool of 3 → exactly 3; the `naive` control double-books |
| A retried request never creates a second booking | `Idempotency-Key` per user: in-flight → 409, done → stored answer replayed, different body → 422, 5xx → released ([ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-idempotency-keys.md)) | [`idempotency.test.ts`](test/integration/idempotency.test.ts), including a gated first request with nine duplicates behind it |
| Payment webhooks in any order, with duplicates, converge to one state | ordered by the provider's timestamp, deduplicated by event id, applied under a row lock, a state machine that never leaves CONFIRMED ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-webhooks-ordered-by-provider-time.md)) | [`webhooks.test.ts`](test/integration/webhooks.test.ts): reversed, duplicated, three shuffled copies delivered concurrently |
| An unpaid hold releases its seat even if its expiry job was lost | a delayed BullMQ job per hold plus a periodic sweeper; expiry is one guarded `UPDATE` judged by the database clock | [`holds.test.ts`](test/integration/holds.test.ts) |
| Side effects happen exactly once per event, and never for a transaction that rolled back | transactional outbox, relay with `SKIP LOCKED`, consumer that claims the job id in a transaction ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-outbox-and-an-idempotent-consumer.md)) | [`outbox.test.ts`](test/integration/outbox.test.ts) |
| All of the above, in any interleaving | — | [`booking-sequences.property.test.ts`](test/integration/booking-sequences.property.test.ts): fast-check drives random sequences of book / replay / pay / cancel / expire / sweep against the real database and checks every invariant after every step |

The integration tests start Postgres 17 and Redis 8 in Testcontainers and boot the API and the
worker in-process; nothing is mocked below the HTTP layer.

## The booking path

```
POST /bookings  (Idempotency-Key, X-User-Id)
  │ claim the key IN_FLIGHT ─────────── duplicate in flight → 409 request_in_flight
  │ validate (startsAt < endsAt, ≤ 8 h, resource exists)
  │ reserve under BOOKING_STRATEGY ──── no capacity → 409 no_capacity
  │ create a payment intent ─────────── provider down → hold cancelled, 502
  │ attach it, write outbox booking.held, schedule the expiry job
  └ 201 { booking, payment: { id, clientSecret } }   ·   store the answer under the key

POST /webhooks/payments (Stripe-Signature) → APPLIED | STALE | DUPLICATE | ORPHANED | IGNORED | UNKNOWN
DELETE /bookings/:id (owner) → CANCELLED; a paid booking also requests a refund through the outbox
worker: expire-hold jobs, the sweeper, the outbox relay, the notifications consumer
```

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 201 | held; pay within `HOLD_TTL_SECONDS` |
| 409 `no_capacity` | someone else has the seat for that time |
| 409 `request_in_flight` | the same key is still being processed — retry later with the same key |
| 422 `idempotency_key_reused` | the same key with a different request |
| 400 | validation, missing `Idempotency-Key` or `X-User-Id` |
| 503 `retry_exhausted` | a retrying strategy gave up under contention; retry with backoff |

Swagger UI at `/docs`, the document at `/openapi.json`. There is no authentication: the demo
identifies users by the `X-User-Id` header, which is the one thing you would not ship.

## Payments

Stripe when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set (PaymentIntents, `Stripe-Signature` verification with
`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`); otherwise an in-repo fake provider whose intents live in the database
and whose events are Stripe-shaped and **signed with the real Stripe scheme**, so the webhook
endpoint runs one verification path for both. `POST /fake-psp/payments/:id/pay` plays the
customer paying, delivering `created / processing / succeeded` shuffled and with a duplicate —
the tests and the demo use it; it answers 404 when Stripe is configured.

## Try it

```bash
just up && just migrate && just seed   # Postgres 17 + Redis 8 in Docker, schema, seven resources
just api                               # http://localhost:3000/docs
just worker                            # expiry, sweeper, outbox relay, notifications (another terminal)
just demo                              # the story: hold, retry, race, shuffled webhooks, cancel, expiry
```

Or the whole stack in Docker (`HOLD_TTL_SECONDS=20` to watch a hold expire during the demo):

```bash
HOLD_TTL_SECONDS=20 just app && just demo
```

Pick a strategy with `BOOKING_STRATEGY=advisory|for_update|optimistic|serializable|exclusion`
(`naive` is refused in production). Run the benchmark with `just bench <strategy>` or
`just bench-all` (needs `brew install k6`); `just check` runs what CI runs.

## Design notes

- [ADR 0001 — five ways to serialise a booking, all kept, one active](docs/adr/0001-five-ways-to-serialise-a-booking.md)
- [ADR 0002 — idempotency keys: in-flight is a conflict, answers are stored, a reused key is an error](docs/adr/0002-idempotency-keys.md)
- [ADR 0003 — webhooks ordered by the provider's clock, not by arrival](docs/adr/0003-webhooks-ordered-by-provider-time.md)
- [ADR 0004 — a transactional outbox and an idempotent consumer](docs/adr/0004-outbox-and-an-idempotent-consumer.md)

Things I would want a reviewer to notice:

- The exclusion constraint is added and dropped at startup by the strategy module, so the other
  four are measured without it. Prisma does not model exclusion constraints; the index on
  `tstzrange("startsAt","endsAt")` is hand-written in the first migration.
- Prisma 7 surfaces Postgres errors three different ways (driver-adapter `cause.kind`, `P2xxx`
  codes, raw-query `meta.code`); `pgCode()` in `src/common/errors.ts` normalises them, and the
  serializable strategy answered 500 instead of retrying until it did.
- Expiry, cancellation and webhook application all update the booking row while inserts for the
  same slot may be in flight; under the exclusion strategy those updates can be deadlock victims,
  so they run through `retryOnConflict`.
- Desk pools count a booking against every slot it overlaps (a booking blocks a desk for its
  whole duration). It is simpler than interval colouring and slightly conservative.

## What is missing on purpose

Authentication (a header stands in for it), rate limiting, outbox retention, multi-region
anything. They are not the point of the repository; the invariants are.
